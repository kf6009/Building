\section{Model}
\paragraph{What is the Model}
The model defines the constant \textit{People}.
\begin{tla}
	People <- {"Alun", "Neil", "David", "Michael"}
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
 \@x{\@s{32.8} People \.{\leftarrow} \{\@w{Alun} ,\,\@w{Neil} ,\,\@w{David}
 ,\,\@w{Michael} \}}%
\end{tlatex}

\paragraph{What is the Behaviour spec?}  The behaviour specification is given
by an \emph{Initial predicate and next-state relation}
\subparagraph{Init} \textit{Init}
\subparagraph{Next} \textit{Next}

\paragraph{Invariants} The invariants checked are :
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\mathit{TypeOK}$ & The type invariant from the specification\\
$\forall p \in \mathit{register} : p \in \mathit{People}$ & every
registered person is in People.\\
\begin{tla}
register\subseteq People
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ register \.{\subseteq} People}%
\end{tlatex}
 & register is a subset of People\\
\begin{tla}
\A p \in out : p \in People
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ \A\, p \.{\in} out \.{:} p \.{\in} People}%
\end{tlatex}
 & Everyone outside the building is a person (see next invariant)\\
\begin{tla}
out \subseteq People 
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ out \.{\subseteq} People}%
\end{tlatex}
 & out is a subset of people (says the same thing as the last invariant) \\
\begin{tla}
\A p \in in : p \in register
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ \A\, p \.{\in} in \.{:} p \.{\in} register}%
\end{tlatex}
 & everyone in the building is registered \\
\begin{tla}
in \subseteq register
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ in \.{\subseteq} register}%
\end{tlatex}
 & in is a subset of register \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Results}
A summary of the numbers of states found by the model checking is shown below.

\subsection{Statistics}
\paragraph{States found} for model as a whole

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lr}
	\hline
	States Found & 325 \\
	Distinct States & 81 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Number of next states found} for the actions is:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lr}
	\hline
	\textbf{Action} & \textbf{States found} \\ \hline
	\textit{Init} (line 18) & 1 \\
	\textit{Register} (line 23) & 108 \\
	\textit{Enter} (line 29) & 108 \\
	\textit{Leave} (line 35) & 108 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Discussion}
The (simple) building model has three state variables; the register of users,
the list of people inside the building, and the list of those outside the
building.  The model has the set of people the specification applies to.

There is a redundancy in the state variables, and consistency is enforced by
the type invariant $\textit{register}=\textit{in}\cup\textit{out}$

\paragraph{The Next action } can be interpreted as follows.
\begin{quote}
	There is a person, who can either; be registered, or can enter the building,
	or can Leave the building.
\end{quote}

\begin{tla}
Next ==
    \exists p \in People :   \* There is a person who can either
        \/ Register(p)       \* be registered, or
        \/ Enter(p)          \* enter the building, or
        \/ Leave(p)          \* leave the building
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{ Next \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} \exists\, p \.{\in} People \.{:}\@s{21.44}}%
\@y{%
  There is a person who can either
}%
\@xx{}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} Register ( p )\@s{24.59}}%
\@y{%
  be registered, or
}%
\@xx{}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} Enter ( p )\@s{36.89}}%
\@y{%
  enter the building, or
}%
\@xx{}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} Leave ( p )\@s{19.13}}%
\@y{%

\@xx{}%
